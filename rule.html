        <h2>Set Game rule</h2>

        <p>In the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a "set". For each one of the four
            categories of features — color, number, shape, and shading — the three cards must display that feature as
            either a) all the same, or b) all different. Put another way: For each feature the three cards must avoid
            having two cards showing one version of the feature and the remaining card showing a different version.</p>

        <p>For example, 3 solid red diamonds, 2 solid green squiggles, and 1 solid purple oval form a set, because the
            shadings of the three cards are all the same, while the numbers, the colors, and the shapes among the three
            cards are all different.</p>

        <p>For any set, the number of features that are constant (the same on all three cards) and the number of
            features that differ (different on all three cards) may break down as: all 4 features differing; or 1
            feature being constant and 3 differing; or 2 constant and 2 differing; or 3 constant and 1 differing. (All 4
            features being constant would imply that the three cards in the set are identical, which is impossible since
            no cards in the Set deck are identical.)</p>
